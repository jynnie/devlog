on my way to my SO's place, in the uber, the game idea just hit me.

> lofi magical girl fighting crime in the city.    

that probably makes minimal sense to people who arenâ€™t living in my head (or arenâ€™t familiar with the magical girl genre), but that kind of gives you a sense of how concepts drop into my head. in more words, the idea is a 3rd-person, single-player, action game about a girl who can magically transform and fights crime in a city. i was heavily inspired by the comic, [magical beatdown](https://gumroad.com/l/hYJao) by Jenn Woodall, i happened across earlier that day.

_i take a bit of space to reflect on my process of scoping the project, if that doesnâ€™t interest you, skip to the next ðŸŒˆ_

i had a lot of ideas for a story, different fight mechanics, and visual aesthetics in that uber; but sat down afterwards to pare it down to a weekâ€™s scope. before that, i made explicit my goals for the week. i needed a direction and priorities in order to scope prototype(s). and i think a really good way of being honest and detailed with yourself about your priorities is outlining what your non-goals are. instead of rewriting, i'll just share an image of my rolling doc.

while, i broke the idea up into three intermediary prototypes, i only really plan to work towards the first one for the week. but roadmapping a future helps me break out what is worth focusing on now and what can be focus blasted on later. (it also makes me feel better to roadmap my too-big-for-now ideas so i feel like they have a future haha). since my goals are to focus on building up technical skills, my steps focus on polishing small bits and not trying to innovate.

ðŸŒˆ on monday, i put together a couple of moodboards of aesthetics and character concepts.

finally i was super taken by the low-poly aesthetic, so i put together a moodboard for that
