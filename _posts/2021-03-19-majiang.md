<div markdown="1">

i've been very taken with card games in the last year or so (it's been quite a while since i've written a log). for their versatility to handle "classic" card games to social card games to trading card and dueling games. so i've begun to develop a card game system, tentatively called 「card.pak」 with an engine dubbed 「wukong」 -- and the first project on that road, was **majiang**.

**[majiang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahjong)**, also commonly written as mahjong, is a game i grew up with. as i grew, i learned more and more variations of the game from friends who learned different regional rules. yet, somehow, the only versions of the game i could find online were Riichi mahjong or "American" mahjong.

thus one of my biggest considerations when implementing was building a system that would be extensible to implementing variations of majiang.

you might've noticed all of this is in the past tense so far -- that's because i've already got a working version based off the Cantonese majiang rules. if you already know the rules, you can try it out with some friends [here](https://majiang.web.app/).

this version of the rules i've dubbed "dianxin" 「点心」 in honor of the pastries in Guangzhou, the place where i learned this variation of majiang. it's been tough finding accurate(?) names for every variation since, while they're often regional, even in region have variations. (if you know a more legit name for any of the variations, please let me know!)

the rules for dianxin majiang are very similar to Cantonese or "Old Hong Kong" rules.

- a hand is eligible to win if it has 4 melds of 3 and one pair of identical tiles (眼/eyes)
- there are no restrictions to what kind fo tile can make up the 眼/eyes
- there are no exceptions made for special hands (i.e. 十三不靠, 七堆).

it's the easiest variation of the rules to teach in my opinion, and it's what i've taught all my uni friends to play (haha). more rule variations to come, once i've fixed some stuff.

you might wonder why i've been opting for the spelling "majiang" as "mahjong". it's definitely less common, but i think that'll also help when trying to search/remember/find chinese majiang. i don't want to compete with riichi mahjong or american mahjong -- they're just different games. plus, i think it's a nice nod since the hanyu [pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin) for 麻将 is "majiang" (aka it's what you type while using the phonetic chinese keyboard to get the characters).

i'll update more about both this project and the adjacent card.pak / wukong projects in future logs. look forward to a post dedicated to the visual design.
