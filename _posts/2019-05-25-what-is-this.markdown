**rx** is my "distillery" collection of my projects ("brews") and documentation of their progress. i really like coffee and drinks and was inspired by the term "homebrew". thus each project a brew and each update a pour. i tend to have a lot of thoughts and enjoy documenting my thought process. you can sort pours by brew with the links in the top right. hope my workflows and random ideas are fun to look through.
