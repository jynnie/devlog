i picked up _the future_ by Nick Montfort last summer and have been slowly (very slowly considering it's only 155 pages long...) making my way through it. in chapter 5, montfort discusses the role and impact of world fairs and envisioning the future. world fairs have since lost their sheen in the current century. instead, these communal scenes of "future-ing" have fractured into various conferences and cons: fifty-person academic conferences, bursting comiket, streamed corporate product reveals.

could we have a large-scale united fair in this day and age? what would this future fair look like? should we?

regional, national, and discipline-al boundaries seem fuzzy ways to organize a future fair now. and AR/VR technology illuminates new ways of entering and participating in such a fair. is [TED](https://www.ted.com/about/our-organization/history-of-ted) actually a future fair of today? i've been thinking about how we can create a space or forum to construct, "mindshare" \[montfort 65\], and iterate on future visions that's inclusive, non-corrupt and non-corporate, and accessible.

can we make an empowering, future-making space? a modern #futurefair?
