<div markdown="1">
i've been thinking about tackling trying new things a week at a time for the summer. and finally, halfway through summer, i've begun. this week, i'm trying to build a bite-sized, polished 3d game. the goal is mainly to get my feet wet with new tech and working in 3d, not invent a new genre or focus on mechanics. i'll be updating with semi-daily (since i'm already 3 days in...) posts about what's happenning.
