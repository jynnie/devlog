title: designing majiang

the visual design of Majiang is deeply personal to me. i both wanted the visual design to capture some of the roots of what playing majiang was like for me growing up; but also make it look good on the web. (i also just have a predilection to more “minimalist” design)

![image: play at the table][table-photo]

i started with shape. majiang is a square game. no matter the number of people playing. the walls are square and we sit around the table. you look at each other and there’s something unifying about that.

i spent a lot of time thinking about fitting different screen sizes and whether I wanted to maintain the square. in the end, i decided it was important to me to maintain the idea of the square. i jiggled it around to fit the common horizontal shape of screens, but the ratio doesn’t change when you change the window size. so vertical layouts suffer a little bit, but everyone sees the same shape. much like how everyone sees the same table when played together.

at the center of the table, a square rests with indicator to the current player’s turn, the remaining number of tiles, and the starting wind of the round. the center is the flashiest part of the table. with a shape design reminiscent of automatic majiang tables (square surrounding a circle) and general radial symmetry (as if allowing readability to wherever someone sits at a table).

since there wasn’t much room to accommodate visuals for the wall (also noted that most online riichi mahjong apps also omit displaying the wall) — i felt it prudent to also include some other indicator of how much of the wall remains. thus we have the remaining tile count in the center.

for the style of both the table center, player seats, and tiles — i was inspired by minimalism in chinese handwriting practice books, japanese graphic “print” designs, and traditional chinese brush paintings.

the resulting style is line work heavy, with few solid blocks. rectangles and sharp edges make up the "table" style. as for colors, i drew on the colors in traditional chinese brush paintings, plus an inky navy blue.

the only shapes that aren't sharp corners - are the tiles. i really wanted the tiles to feel like those with classic sets i played with at home or at majiang parlors.

i gave the tiles in your hand some dimensionality to really pop, and then carried the general shape to the smaller tiles that are discarded or played. i like that it feels like their backs are a solid inky color. i wanted them to feel like they could lift off the screen. to add to that, i added a subtle shadow, and on hover, they lift up a little.

discarded tiles become part of the table. they are a bit transparent and don't have filled in faces. much like the way previously discarded tiles matter less and just become part of the table when playing irl.

they're a little overly organized though, which is the one thing i'm not super happy with. the structured square makes it aesthetically hard to break. so you miss out on the silly, homey feel of tiles scattered around the table.

![image: call out design ideas][call-outs]

call outs - actions that play tiles openly - were another aspect that i thought hard about for design. in person, when you want to take a tile from another, you call out the type of take. the call is often accompanied by swagger and jest. vocalization is a part of the fun and part of the etiquette of playing majiang. when you discard a tile to the center, you also call out what you’ve tossed. it signals you've finished your turn and someone else can go.

so when it came to designing the buttons to do a call out, i really wanted to integrate the exact chinese term for everything. with the exception of drawing (which doesn't have a vocal call out corresponding) and skipping (which isn't an explicit action when you play in real life), i used both the character for the term and the pinyin to read it aloud. i think it's a nice way of carrying through that oral tradition to a digital version. i also like the idea of newbies learning majiang with the call outs.

there's a lot of small details i can continue to delve into. like the choice to use brush strokes for visual flare to buttons. like why these colors. like the tile face visuals (it's the set i grew up with). like the victory screen. but i've covered the big stuff and i think anyone who's read all this has a feel for what i thought about (and this log is getting really log).

so i'll just leave you with some of the color variation mock ups i made next to their inspirations.
