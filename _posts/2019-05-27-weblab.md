every january, a web development class and competition is run by students for students at MIT. we've been alive and kicking for a long time, but have only recently started making specific tools for the class ourselves. last summer, i helped revamp the [class website](http://weblab.mit.edu); but this summer, we're looking to build a tool for students to turn-in milestones and for us to handle grading.

the biggest design challenge is designing something simple and flexible. if the class changes it's structure, we want the tool to be able to handle that - and easily. which is the hard part. since technology has a tendency to commit us to certain organizational structures and rules (gestures at Latour and non-human actor theory).

in addition, we want the code to also be easily maintainable. in case an API or third-party service we rely on hits the fan (by mlab). personally, this is something i've struggled with in past projects. while i try to document, experimental (media lab) attitudes and jank hacks aren't intelligible no matter how hard you comment. so a personal goal of mine is to develop the skill of writing maintainable code that's _ready for change_.
